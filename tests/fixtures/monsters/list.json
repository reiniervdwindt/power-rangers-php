The Megazord and Dragonzord then battled the Two-Headed Parrot with neither side gaining an upper hand. The zord attacks seemed to only agitate the parrot, rather than weaken it, so they formed the Ultrazord. After the Ultrazord was formed the Two-Headed Parrot cowered before the Ultrazord, begging them not to use it on it.

He was surprisingly good at hand to hand combat, the Megazord's punches not fazing him. However, when the Dragonzord comes to the rescue and frees the Megazord from its sealed containment, the tide is turned. The Rangers form the MegaDragonzord, and use the spinning Z-Sphere to obliterate Weaveworm in a flash of bright light. Before the zord battle, the Dragonzord Battle Mode is disassembled, perhaps in a delayed formation of the MegaDragonzord, much like when the Ultrazord was formed against Samurai Fan Man.\",\"images\":[]}]"
